<!-- what "google" data resources we want to be able to access -->
<!-- example name , email, profile picture ex ex : what resources does my web application want to collect from the authorization and from google about the user -->
			  <!-- data-socpe="openid" -->


<!-- data-redirecturi="postmessage" :: enables the one time use code flow -->

<!-- data-accesstype="offline" :: means that our server can make requests to the google api server even if the user is not logged in -->

<!-- data-cookiepolicy="single_host_origin" :: determines the scope of the URI's that can access the cookie:: single_host_origin refers to when we only have a single host name and no subdomains. -->

<!-- data-callback="signInCallback":: specifies a callback function (Im guessing from jQuery).  If the user clicks and calls this function the function executes and send the one time use code along with an access token. -->


<!-- data-approvalpromt="force" :: means that our user has to log in each time we visit the login page and doesnt check to see if they are already logged in -->
